## Corona

A Meteor application boilerplate that applies the principles of the Mantra architecture. Please read the [Mantra](https://kadirahq.github.io/mantra) specification if you are unaware of it. Corona uses [React-Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) as its routing solution. [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) is used as an application-wide state manager, while [React-Router-Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux) is used to synchronise any route changes into application state. Corona also implements [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) for managing changes to the document head of different React containers.
